# hello-world
My first test repository
I am setting up a repository to manage files for the Terran Stellar Navy RP Community server configuration
This organization plays the Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator regularly with a consistent background story
We have a 
- MOD for the game
- Sandbox mission script for our GMs
- Ship definition file for automatic configuration of the server using NoseyNick's Nebula game server method
- Stellar Nav Console that documents the sandbox system and sector maps and provides interactive viewing
